# Printed digits dataset
This folder contains data from the (printed-digits-dataset)[https://github.com/kaydee0502/printed-digits-dataset/] repository.
It's a dataset of 10 classes of printed digits (0-9) with around 3000 images specifically designed for sudoku grid recognition.

We are going to use it in combination with the MNIST dataset to train a model capable of recognizing handwritten AND printed digits.

It separates data into directories for each class from 1-9, and 0 that represents the empty cell.
