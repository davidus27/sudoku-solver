# Sudoku solver proof of concept
This sections tests individual parts of the project.


## Design of the solution

## Development

The implementation is done in Python Jupyter Notebooks. We are using Tensorflow's [Keras]() for classification and [OpenCV]() for image processing.

## Implementation of the solution

- Identifing a sudoku grid
- Separating sudoku grid into an array of images
- Classification of numbers inside images
